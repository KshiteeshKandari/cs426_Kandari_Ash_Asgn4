Physics Material ETC

Assignment 2: From assignment 2 there was some issues, the multiplayer works, however the player picking up objects kind of got messed up. I tried to contact my groupmate who had the last working code, but they didnt get back to me on time. I tried to
re-implement the picking up but was unable to do so. You can still push objects around to get them to slots to complete the game.

Pyhsics added:
          1) Curtain physics: I added curtains to the PC case that follow a cloth physics, so you can see the curtain swaying back and forth(randomized z-direction movement)/ Added a plane mesh and added the cloth component, then tweaked it to sway around and be fixated at one place.
          2) Bouncy collision on the wall. Changed the physic material for the walls that surround us. Change the multipliers and friction values to get the bouncy collision physics off the wall.
Lighting:
          1) Spot lights: Added 1 spot light inside the case that is red, this is to make the player feel the urgency of the prompt. Added 5 spot lights that shine on the objects that need to be picked up.
Billboard:
          1) Pick up object Billboard, I initally didnt have the billboard that would tell user where to pick up objects from, so added that.
          2) Added a creepy looking eye that seems to look at you no matter where you go, this is to add to the theme of players urgency.
